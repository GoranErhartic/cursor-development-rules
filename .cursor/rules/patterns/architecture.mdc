# Architecture Principles

## Preferred Patterns

### Vertical Slice Architecture
- Organize by feature, not by technical layer
- Each slice contains its own command/query, handler, validator, and entities
- Minimize cross-slice dependencies

### Clean Architecture
- **Domain** — Entities, Value Objects, Domain Events (no dependencies)
- **Application** — Use cases, interfaces, DTOs (depends on Domain)
- **Infrastructure** — Data access, external services (implements interfaces)
- **API** — Controllers/endpoints, middleware/filters (composition root)

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separate read (queries) from write (commands) operations
- Use mediator or dispatcher pattern for routing
- Commands return `Result<T>`, queries return DTOs

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Aggregates** — Consistency boundaries with single root
- **Value Objects** — Immutable, equality by value
- **Domain Events** — Publish for cross-aggregate communication

## Design Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SOLID** | Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion |
| **DRY** | Extract common logic; avoid premature abstraction |
| **KISS** | Prefer straightforward solutions over clever ones |
| **YAGNI** | Don't build features speculatively |

## Layering Guidelines

- Dependencies flow inward (outer layers depend on inner, never reverse)
- Domain layer has no external dependencies
- Infrastructure implements domain interfaces
- API layer orchestrates, doesn't contain business logic
