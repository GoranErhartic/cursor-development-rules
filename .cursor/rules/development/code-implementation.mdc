# Code Implementation Workflow

When implementing features, refactoring code, or fixing bugs, you must adhere to the following workflow and checklists.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Pre-Work
Before writing code:
- Clarify any ambiguous requirements.
- Identify existing patterns in the codebase to replicate.
- Verify required dependencies are available.

### 2. Implementation (TDD Cycle)
- **Write failing test first** that defines the expected behavior
- **Implement minimum code** to make the test pass
- **Refactor** while tests remain green
- Repeat for each behavior unit

> **Exception:** Trivial changes (config, formatting, single-line fixes) may skip TDD with documented justification.

### 3. Verification (Definition of Done)
Before marking the task as complete, ensure:
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No secrets exposed
- [ ] Input sanitization at boundaries
- [ ] Follows existing patterns
- [ ] Error handling implemented

## Summary Requirement
Every implementation task must conclude with a summary in the following format:
1. **What changed**
2. **Why**
3. **How to verify**
4. **Limitations**
