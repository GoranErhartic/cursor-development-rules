# TDD Planning Requirements

## When Creating Implementation Plans

Before any implementation work, the plan MUST include:

1. **Test Scenarios** - List of test cases to be written
2. **Expected Behaviors** - What each test validates
3. **Test File Locations** - Where tests will be created

## Plan Template

| Test Name | Behavior | Priority |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| `Method_WhenCondition_ShouldResult` | Description | High/Med/Low |

## Verification
- [ ] Plan includes test specifications
- [ ] Tests are written before implementation
- [ ] Each behavior has corresponding test
